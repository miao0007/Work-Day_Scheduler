### 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
The aim of this web application is to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
I use the Moment.js library to work with date and time.
